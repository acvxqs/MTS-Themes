# MTS-Themes

Repo for MTS standard (1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3) as devised back in the day.

Most popular was the MTS 1.1 standard.

## Notes:

* Using Notepad++, theme files' codepages were set and then converted to UTF8.
* Some theme files are still ANSI encoded, these theme files use lime.fon, bright.fon, Terminal etc.

# Peace and Protection 4.22 - [complete mIRC script]

Pai created P&P and released it back in Feb 2002. Within it she created a MTS 1.1 compatible theme engine.
It was coded in pure mSL (hence it's still working)

P&P can be had on GitHub at: [https://github.com/solbu/Peace-and-Protection](https://github.com/solbu/Peace-and-Protection)

## Notes:

* Supports up to MTS 1.1
* Not all themes here load well and need a little adjustment. 
* Some themes here have been modded to work in P&P, see: [https://github.com/solbu/Peace-and-Protection/tree/themes](https://github.com/solbu/Peace-and-Protection/tree/themes)
