Theme Engine: MTS (mIRC Theme Standard)
Theme Name: CombinationX v1.00

_ Welcome _

Welcome to the CombinationX Theme module for the MTS! This theme 
is unlike most other themes, which usually choose a 'color scheme' to 
base their colors on; for this theme, I've tried to add a combination of 
color choices to create a sleek, easy-to-view design. I've also added 3 
other schemes, besides the default one, that don't change colors, as 
I've said this is NOT a color-driven theme, but rather it changes the 
visual 'layout'.

I really hope that you enjoy this theme, because I've not 
seen a lot of people who enjoy 'blue-oriented-background' 
themes, and for that purpose, I tried creating one that appealed to 
those users. Thank you! :-)

_ Installation _

The only thing that you need do is extract all of the files into your 
MTS themes-enabled folder. Depending on what theme engine 
you are using, simply select CombinationX and the scheme from the 
4 available ones. ENJOY!

_ Schemes _

No @/+/-/?
     Having this option as your scheme will disable the pre-empt text 
that goes before channel or private texts. For example:

[Channel Text]
(@)(OppedNick) Hello
(+)(VoicedNick) Wazza???
(-)(RegularNick) Hrmm, this is boring.

[Private Text]
(?)(YourNick) Hrmm, this is a query, ya?

     Instead, it will turn out like this:

[Channel Text]
(OppedNick) Hello
(VoicedNick) Wazza???
(RegularNick) Hrmm, this is boring.

[Private Text]
(YourNick) Hrmm, this is a query, ya?

     As you can see, this is no MAJOR scheme change, but I've notice 
that quite a few people don't take a shine from pre-empting text 
with status icons, and for that reason, you can disable it.

+TimeStamp:
   This option will allow you to 'timestamp' all spoken texts. The 
TimeStamp option was added because I, myself, do not enjoy 
timestamping at all. Fortunately, I try to think on the user-end and 
keep an open mind about the millions (billions?) of users who do. So, 
there you have it ;-)

/|\ And No @/+/-/?
     This option will enable your TimeStamping as well as the option 
to disable the pre-empt text icons. I didn't want the timestamp users 
to be excluded from this option.
